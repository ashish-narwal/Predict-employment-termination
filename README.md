# Predict-employment-termination

The company wants to apply data science principles and steps to deal with a critical HR issue: employee churn. It realizes that when good people leave, it costs far more to replace them than providing them with some incentives to keep them. So it would like to be data-driven in the HR decisions it makes with respect to employee retention.

The following questions are among the ones they would like answered:

What proportion of our staff is leaving?
Where is it occurring?
How does Age and Length of Service affect termination?
What, if anything, else contributes to it?
Can we predict future terminations?
If so, how well can we predict?
